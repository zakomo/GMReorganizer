# Google Music Reorganizer 

Google Music Reorganizer is a small script written to reorganize the songs after downloading the Google Music dump.
Google put all of my songs in a flat archive with all the songs in the same level and a csv with the info.

GMR is an attempt to reorganize said archive back into a meaningful structure.
